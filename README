Parse-Gnaw

This is a parser designed in pure perl without resorting to 
regular expressions. Rules are made up of array references.
Subroutines are provided to help generate properly formatted
rules.  

This is generation 2 of Parse::Gnaw, starting from revision 0.600.
Previous revisions had grammar calls return code references to 
dynamically generated subroutines (closures). Gen 2 grammar calls
return references to dynamically generated arrays. 

The main improvement there is that since it isn't a subroutine call,
a recursive rule doesn't automatically blow up. Gen1 Parse::Gnaw
would go into an infinite loop if a rule was recursive.

Another minor advantage is that arrays are more friendly to 
Data::Dumper.

Another major upgrade is that Parse::Gnaw version 2 is intended
to support parsing multi-dimensional text, rather than simple
one-dimensional strings. The string format is merely a linked
list, so the text can be any shape, size, or interconnectivity
you want.

Related to multi-dimensional text parsing is the ability to
parse multi-dimensional text in either linear or non-linear
mode. For example, the following two dimension text block:

a b c
d e f
h i j

If you use straight line parsing, it will match the pattern:

	'a', 'b', 'c'

If you enable non-linear parsing, it will also match the pattern:

	'b', 'c', 'f', 'j', 'i'

Non linear parsing in text with many interconnections/dimensions
becomes extremely computational intensive very quickly.
